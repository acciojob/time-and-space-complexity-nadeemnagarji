	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms are those that accomplish their tasks with minimal time complexity, ensuring that as the input grows, the increase in execution time remains manageable.

        Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to perform a task based on the input size. It is denoted by O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Algorithms with lower space complexity are considered more memory-efficient, which is crucial when dealing with large datasets or limited memory resources.
        <b>Space Complexity</b> is a critical consideration in optimizing algorithms to make the most efficient use of available memory.
